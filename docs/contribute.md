title: Contribute

The framework consists of two main parts, each lives in a separate repository, the first part is the `core` which contains the framework core packages. the second part is `gocondor` which has the project folder structure and responsible of gluing everything together.

To contribute you simply need to clone these two repositories locally and create new branches from the `develop` branch, add your changes, then open up a `PR` to the `develop` branch.

Here is how you can clone and set up the development workflow in your local machine:

1. Create the organization `gocondor` directory in your workspace, make sure the full path to it looks like below:
```bash
$GOPATH/src/ginthub.com/gocondor
```
2. clone the repository `core` inside the organization `gocondor` directory:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gocondor/core.git
```
3. clone the repository `gocondor`:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:gocondor/gocondor.git
```
4. cd into the project `gocondor` and open up `go.mod` in your editor and add the line `github.com/gocondor/gocondor/core => [full-local-path-to-core]` to the `replace`statement, make sure it looks something like this:
```go
module github.com/gocondor/gocondor

replace (
github.com/gocondor/core => /path-to-go-workspace/src/ginthub.com/gocondor

github.com/gocondor/gocondor/config => ./config
github.com/gocondor/gocondor/handlers => ./handlers
github.com/gocondor/gocondor/middlewares => ./middlewares
github.com/gocondor/gocondor/models => ./models
)
```
Note:
this is needed to tell go that instead of using the remote core package use the local copy where we will be making the changes, once you are done, open a `PR` to `develop` branch.
